# User Data Processing

This repository contains a solution to a task that asks to process user's data from a JSON file and to write a specific information to text files:

## Task: Process User Data from JSON
Write a program that performs the following tasks:

1. Reads the content of the `users.json` file, which contains user data.
2. Counts the number of users in the file.
3. Retrieves the names of all users.
4. Writes the number of users to a text file named `user_count.txt`.
5. Writes the names of all users to a text file named `user_names.txt`.

### Solution Overview

The program is written in JavaScript using Node.js. It reads the `users.json` file, extracts the relevant information (number of users and their names), and writes the data to the specified text files.

- The JSON file is located in the `Jsons` folder.
- The output text files are saved in the `Texts` folder.
  
### Files and Folders

> The solution is included in a folder named "userDataProcessing".

> The `Jsons` and `Texts` folders are inside the "userDataProcessing" folder.
